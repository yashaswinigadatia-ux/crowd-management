# 🧠 Crowd Management using YOLOv5

A **real-time crowd detection system** that monitors crowded areas using **YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once)** deep learning model.  
It helps estimate **crowd density** and visualize **people detection** with bounding boxes — making it useful for **public safety, event management, and surveillance systems**.
